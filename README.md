### Add_history

### Libraries

#include <stdio.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>

### Prototype

void add_history(const char *line);

### Description (engl)

The add_history function it is used to add a line of text to the history list mantained by
readline
Pratically it mantains all the command used or read by readline.
Description (Ita)
la funzione permette di tenere traccia di tutti le cose scritte inserite grazie al richiamo della
funzione readline().

### Flag per compilare


-lreadline

### Esempio pratico in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>
int main() {
char* line = readline("Enter a line of text: ");
// Add the entered line to history
if (line[0] != '\0') {
add_history(line);
}
free(line); // Free the dynamically allocated memory
return 0;
}
```
In this example, after reading a line of text using **readline** , we check if the line is not empty
( **line[0] != '\0'** ). If it's not empty, we add the line to the history using **add_history**. This
ensures that the line will be available in the history for future navigation or recall.
By adding lines to the history, users can easily recall and re-enter previously entered lines,
saving them from retyping or copy-pasting repetitive or frequently used input.
Note that the history list maintained by **readline** is specific to the current session and is not
persistent across multiple sessions. If you want to save the history to a file for future
sessions, you can use functions like **read_history** and **write_history** provided by the **readline**
library.

## access

### Libraries:

```
#include <unistd.h>
```
### Prototype

```
int access(const char *path, int mode);
```
### Description (engl)


In the prototype the path argument specifies the path to the file or directory whose
accesibility is being checked, and the mode argument indicates the type of accessibility
check to perform.
Is a function used to check accessibility or permissions of a file or directory
The mode can take one or a combination of the following checks:
**F_OK** : Checks if the file exists.
**R_OK** : Checks if the file is readable.
**W_OK** : Checks if the file is writable.
**X_OK** : Checks if the file is executable.

### Description (ita)

Questa funzione serve per controllare l‚Äôassebilit√† o i permessi di un file in una directory,
puoi usare diverse macro per diversi check oppure usarle tutte insieme (le macro sono
appena sopra), esse vengono inserite nell‚Äôargomento mode (guarda prototipo)

### Esempio in codice C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
const char* path = "/path/to/file.txt";
// Check if the file exists and is readable if (access(path, F_OK | R_OK) == 0) {
printf("File exists and is readable.\n");
} else {
perror("File does not exist or is not readable");
}
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we check if the file specified by the **path** variable exists and is readable
by combining the **F_OK** and **R_OK** flags. If the **access** function returns 0, we print a success
message. Otherwise, we use **perror** to print the corresponding error message.
The **access** function is often used to perform permission checks before performing file
operations or to determine the accessibility of a file or directory in order to handle it
appropriately in a program.


## Read, Close and Open functions (altogether

## because we kinda saw them already)

```
1. open function:
Prototype: int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
Library: <fcntl.h>
Description: Opens the file specified by pathname with the given flags and mode.
It returns a file descriptor on success and -1 on error.
The open function is used to open a file and obtain a file descriptor, which is a
small non-negative integer representing an open file in the operating system.
It takes the file path and a set of flags as arguments to specify the purpose of the
file access (e.g., read-only, write-only, or both).
If the file is successfully opened, the open function returns a valid file descriptor.
Otherwise, it returns -1 to indicate an error.
2. read function:
The read function is used to read data from an open file into a buffer.
Prototype: ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
Library: <unistd.h>
Description: Reads data from an open file descriptor fd into the buffer pointed to
by buf. It attempts to read up to count bytes and returns the number of bytes
read. Returns 0 at the end of the file and -1 on error.
It takes the file descriptor, buffer pointer, and the maximum number of bytes to
read as arguments.
The function attempts to read up to the specified number of bytes from the file
into the buffer.
The return value of read indicates the number of bytes actually read. If the return
value is 0, it signifies the end of the file. A return value of -1 indicates an error.
3. close function:
The close function is used to close an open file and release the associated
resources.
It takes the file descriptor as an argument.
```

```
When called, close closes the file, flushing any pending writes, and frees the
resources associated with it.
If the file is closed successfully, close returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -1 to
indicate an error.
```
### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#define BUFFER_SIZE 128
int main() {
int fileDescriptor = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
if (fileDescriptor == -1) {
perror("Failed to open the file");
return 1;
}
char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
ssize_t bytesRead;
while ((bytesRead = read(fileDescriptor, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE)) > 0) {
```
// Process the read data, e.g., print it write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, bytesRead); (^)
}
if (bytesRead == -1) {
perror("Failed to read the file");
close(fileDescriptor);
return 1;
}
close(fileDescriptor);
return 0;
}
In this example, the **open** function is used to open the file "example.txt" in read-only
mode, and if successful, it returns a valid file descriptor. The **read** function is then
used in a loop to read data from the file into a buffer. The **write** function is used to
display the read data on the standard output. The loop continues until the **read**
function returns 0, indicating the end of the file. Finally, the **close** function is used to
close the file and release the associated resources.
Note: Error handling is important when working with file I/O functions. In the example,
**perror** is used to print error messages with descriptive information.


## Wait3 and wait

### Functions statistics:

```
1. wait3 function:
Prototype: pid_t wait3(int *status, int options, struct rusage *rusage);
Library: <sys/wait.h>
Description: The wait3 function is an older version of the wait function that
provides more control over the behavior of process waiting and resource
usage information.
The status parameter is a pointer to an integer where the termination status
of the child process will be stored.
The options parameter is used to specify additional options for process
waiting. These options can control the behavior of the waiting process, such
as the type of child process to wait for or the handling of stopped or traced
processes.
The rusage parameter is a pointer to a struct rusage that receives resource
usage information for the terminated child process, such as CPU time,
memory usage, and more.
2. wait4 function:
Prototype: pid_t wait4(pid_t pid, int *status, int options, struct rusage
*rusage);
Library: <sys/wait.h>
Description: The wait4 function is similar to wait3 , but it allows you to specify
the process ID (PID) of the child process to wait for explicitly.
The pid parameter specifies the process ID of the child process to wait for. If
pid is set to -1, the wait4 function waits for any child process.
The status , options , and rusage parameters have the same meanings as in
wait.
```
### Difference with wait

```
The key difference between these functions and the normal wait function is that
wait3 and wait4 provide more control and information about process termination
and resource usage. They allow you to specify additional options, such as
```

handling specific types of child processes or retrieving detailed resource usage
statistics using the **rusage** parameter.
The standard **wait** function, on the other hand, is a simplified version that waits
for any child process and retrieves only the termination status of the child.
It's worth noting that **wait3** and **wait4** are not commonly used in modern
programming, as the functionality they provide can often be achieved using other,
more portable and standardized mechanisms. The **waitpid** function, for example,
is a commonly used alternative that allows more fine-grained control over waiting
for specific child processes.
So they are almost useless seeing that we can use the waitpid function already

## Signal

### Libraries

#include <signal.h>

### Prototype

void (*signal(int signum, void (*handler)(int)))(int);

### Description (engl)

The **signal** function in C is used to handle various signals in a program. Signals
are asynchronous notifications delivered to a process to indicate events or
exceptional conditions occurring in the system or the process itself. These events
can range from user-generated events (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C to send the SIGINT
signal) to system-related events (e.g., a segmentation fault causing the SIGSEGV
signal).
The **signal** function takes two arguments: **signum** and **handler**. Here's an
explanation of each:

#### Arguments explanation:

```
signum : Specifies the signal number or type of signal to be handled. Signal
numbers are represented by constants defined in the <signal.h> header file,
such as SIGINT , SIGTERM , SIGSEGV , etc.
```

**handler** : Specifies the action to be taken when the specified signal is
received. It can be one of the following:
**SIG_DFL** (default): The default behavior associated with the signal is
taken. For most signals, this terminates the program.
**SIG_IGN** (ignore): The signal is ignored, and no action is taken.
A function pointer: A user-defined signal handler function that is called
when the specified signal is received. The handler function takes an
integer argument, which represents the signal number.
The **signal** function returns a function pointer that represents the previous signal
handler associated with the specified signal. This can be useful if you want to
preserve the previous behavior of the signal handler and restore it later.

### Description (ita)

La funzione serve a mandare un segnale ad altri processi all‚Äôinterno del
programma, per indicare eventi o momenti eccezionali creati dall‚Äôutente e che ne
richiedono l‚Äôutilizzo (tipo l‚Äôutilizzo del comando Ctrl + C).

#### Arguments explanation(ita)

La funzione Signal riceve due argomenti signum e handlere funzionano cos√¨:
signum: Definisce il tipo di segnale da inviare
handler: definisce l‚Äôazione da eseguire quando il segnale viene ricevuto le
azioni disponibili sono le seguenti:
SIG_DFL: segnale di default, conclude il programma
SIG_IGN: (ignore) il segnale viene ignorato e nessuna azione viene
eseguita
Un puntatore ad una funzione: una funzione creata dall‚Äôutente che dovr√†
gestire il segnale, questa funzione riceve un intero che praticamente
sarebbe il segnale preso
La funzione signal ritorna un puntatore ad una funzione che sarebbe il
segnale precedentement inviato all‚Äôhandler.

### Example of code in C


```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
}
int main() {
// Registering a signal handler for SIGINT
signal(SIGINT, signalHandler);
```
(^) printf("Press Ctrl+C to send SIGINT...\n");
while (1) {
// Main program logic
}
return 0;
}
In this example, we register a signal handler function **signalHandler** to handle
the **SIGINT** signal, which is generated when the user presses Ctrl+C. The
**signal** function is called to set the signal handler. When the **SIGINT** signal is
received, the **signalHandler** function is called, printing a message indicating
the received signal.
It's important to note that the behavior of signal handling can vary across
different operating systems and platforms. Additionally, some signals cannot
be caught or handled. For more advanced signal handling and management,
it is recommended to use the **sigaction** function, which provides more control
and flexibility over signal handling.

### Type of signals

The number and types of signals that can be handled using the **signal**
function can vary depending on the operating system and platform. However,
there are a set of common signals that are supported by most Unix-like
systems. Here are some of the commonly used signals that can be handled
using the **signal** function:
1. **SIGINT** (Interrupt): Generated when the user sends an interrupt signal,
typically by pressing Ctrl+C. It is commonly used to request termination of
a program.
2. **SIGTERM** (Termination): A termination request signal. It is often sent by the
system or a process manager to gracefully terminate a program.


3. **SIGSEGV** (Segmentation Violation): Indicates an invalid memory access or
segmentation fault.
4. **SIGILL** (Illegal Instruction): Generated when an illegal instruction is
encountered by the processor.
5. **SIGABRT** (Abort): Usually generated by the **abort** function to indicate an
abnormal termination of the program.
6. **SIGFPE** (Floating-Point Exception): Generated when a floating-point
arithmetic exception occurs, such as division by zero or an invalid
operation.
7. **SIGALRM** (Alarm): Generated when the timer set by the **alarm** function or
**setitimer** expires.
8. **SIGUSR1** and **SIGUSR2** (User-defined signals): Signals that can be used for
custom purposes by the user.
These are just a few examples of commonly used signals. The complete list
of available signals can vary, and you can refer to the documentation or man
pages of your specific operating system for a comprehensive list of signals
supported.
It's worth noting that the **signal** function may not support all signals on all
platforms. In some cases, platform-specific functions or APIs may be required
to handle certain signals. Additionally, for more advanced and portable signal
handling, the **sigaction** function is often recommended, as it provides more
control and flexibility over signal handling, including the ability to specify
additional options and flags.

## Sigaction

### Library

<signal.h>

### Prototype:

```
int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact);
```
### Description


The **sigaction** function in C is used to manipulate and handle signals with
more control and flexibility compared to the **signal** function. It allows you to
specify the behavior of the signal handler, handle additional flags and options,
and provide advanced signal handling features.
The **sigaction** function takes three arguments: **signum** , **act** , and **oldact**.
Here's an explanation of each:
**signum** : Specifies the signal number or type of signal to be handled,
similar to the **signal** function.
**act** : Pointer to a **struct sigaction** that specifies the action to be taken
when the signal is received. The **struct sigaction** contains information
about the signal handler, flags, and additional options.
**oldact** : Optional pointer to a **struct sigaction** where the previous signal
action will be stored. If not **NULL** , the previous action associated with the
specified signal will be copied to this structure.

#### Sigaction struct:

```
struct sigaction {
void (*sa_handler)(int);
void (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *); sigset_t sa_mask;
int sa_flags;
void (*sa_restorer)(void);
};
```
```
sa_handler : Pointer to the signal handler function that will be called when
the signal is received. It takes an integer argument representing the
signal number.
sa_sigaction : An alternative, more advanced signal handler function that
can receive additional information about the signal through the siginfo_t
structure. If sa_sigaction is specified, sa_handler is ignored.
sa_mask : A set of signals to be blocked while the signal handler is
executing. This prevents other signals from interrupting the handler.
sa_flags : Flags that control the behavior of the signal. It can include
options like SA_RESTART to automatically restart interrupted system calls,
SA_SIGINFO to indicate the use of sa_sigaction instead of sa_handler , and
more.
sa_restorer : Deprecated field and no longer used in modern systems.
```

The **sigaction** function returns 0 on success or -1 on error.

### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
```
(^) void signalHandler(int signum) {
printf("Received signal: %d\n", signum);
// Perform necessary actions based on the signal
}
int main() {
struct sigaction sa;
sa.sa_handler = signalHandler;
sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
sa.sa_flags = 0;
// Registering a signal handler using sigaction
if (sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL) == -1) {
perror("Failed to register signal handler");
return 1; }
printf("Press Ctrl+C to send SIGINT...\n");
while (1) {
// Main program logic
}
return 0;
}
In this example, we use **sigaction** to register the **signalHandler** function to
handle the **SIGINT** signal (Ctrl+C). We populate the **struct sigaction** with the
signal handler function and set the flags and mask appropriately. If the
**sigaction** call succeeds, the **signalHandler** function will be called when the
**SIGINT** signal is received.
The **sigaction** function provides more advanced and portable signal handling
compared to the **signal** function

## Sigemptyset

### Library

<signal.h>


### Prototype

```
int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);
```
### Description

The **sigemptyset** function takes a pointer to a **sigset_t** object, which is
typically represented as a bitset. The function clears all the bits in the signal
set, indicating that no signals are included in the set.
After calling **sigemptyset** , you can add specific signals to the set using the
**sigaddset** function or perform operations with signal sets, such as checking
for specific signals, blocking signals, or manipulating sets using functions like
**sigprocmask**.

### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
int main() {
sigset_t mySet;
// Initialize an empty signal set
if (sigemptyset(&mySet) == -1) {
perror("Failed to initialize signal set");
return 1;
}
// Check if a specific signal is in the set
if (sigismember(&mySet, SIGINT)) {
printf("SIGINT is in the set.\n"); } else {
printf("SIGINT is not in the set.\n");
}
// Add a signal to the set
sigaddset(&mySet, SIGINT);
// Check again after adding the signal
if (sigismember(&mySet, SIGINT)) {
printf("SIGINT is now in the set.\n");
} else {
printf("SIGINT is still not in the set.\n");
}
```
(^) return 0;
}


In this example, we initialize an empty signal set **mySet** using **sigemptyset**. We
then use **sigismember** to check if **SIGINT** (Ctrl+C) is in the set initially, which
should return **0** (false) since we haven't added it yet. After adding **SIGINT** to
the set using **sigaddset** , we check again and observe that **SIGINT** is now
present in the set.
The **sigemptyset** function is commonly used when working with signal sets to
ensure that the set starts empty before adding or manipulating signals within
it.

## sigaddset

### Library

<signal.h>

### Prototype

```
int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signum);
```
### Description

The **sigaddset** function in C is used to add a specific signal to a signal set. It
modifies the signal set by setting the corresponding bit for the specified
signal, indicating that the signal is now included in the set.
The **sigaddset** function takes two arguments: a pointer to a **sigset_t** object
(representing the signal set) and an integer representing the signal number or
type of signal to be added to the set.
After calling **sigaddset** , the corresponding bit for the specified signal is set in
the signal set, indicating that the signal is now included. This allows you to
build a set of signals that you want to manipulate or perform operations on,
such as blocking signals using **sigprocmask** or checking for specific signals
using **sigismember**.

### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
```

int main() { sigset_t mySet; (^)
// Initialize an empty signal set
sigemptyset(&mySet);
// Add a signal to the set
sigaddset(&mySet, SIGINT);
// Check if the signal is in the set
if (sigismember(&mySet, SIGINT)) {
printf("SIGINT is in the set.\n");
} else {
printf("SIGINT is not in the set.\n");
}
return 0;
}
In this example, we initialize an empty signal set **mySet** using **sigemptyset**. We
then use **sigaddset** to add **SIGINT** (Ctrl+C) to the set. After adding the signal,
we use **sigismember** to check if **SIGINT** is in the set and print the appropriate
message.
The **sigaddset** function allows you to build and modify signal sets, enabling
you to perform operations on specific signals or manipulate sets using other
signal-related functions.

## getcwd

### Library

<unistd.h>

### Prototype

```
char *getcwd(char *buf, size_t size);
```
### Description

The **getcwd** function in C is used to get the current working directory of the
process. "cwd" stands for "current working directory." This function allows you
to retrieve the absolute path of the directory in which your program is
currently executing.


The **getcwd** function takes two arguments: **buf** and **size**. Here's an
explanation of each:
**buf** : A pointer to a character array ( **char*** ) where the current working
directory path will be stored. This array should have enough space to
accommodate the path. It is recommended to allocate a buffer of size at
least **PATH_MAX** to ensure sufficient space.
**size** : The size (number of characters) of the buffer provided in **buf**.
The **getcwd** function returns a pointer to the provided buffer **buf** if the
operation is successful. This pointer points to the same memory location as
**buf**. If there is an error, **NULL** is returned, and you can check the value of the
global variable **errno** to determine the specific error condition.

### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
char cwd[PATH_MAX];
// Get the current working directory
if (getcwd(cwd, sizeof(cwd)) != NULL) {
printf("Current working directory: %s\n", cwd);
} else {
perror("getcwd() error");
return 1;
}
```
(^) return 0;
}
In this example, we declare a character array **cwd** to store the current
working directory path. We then call **getcwd** and pass the array along with its
size. If **getcwd** is successful, it prints the current working directory path.
Otherwise, it prints an error message using **perror**.
The **getcwd** function is useful when you need to determine the current
working directory of your program. It is commonly used in file operations, path
manipulation, and managing program execution based on the current working
directory.

## chdir


### library

<unistd.h>

### Prototype

```
int chdir(const char *path);
```
### Description

The **chdir** function in C is used to change the current working directory of the
process to the specified directory. "chdir" stands for "change directory." This
function allows you to navigate to a different directory within the file system.
The **chdir** function takes a single argument **path** , which is a pointer to a null-
terminated string representing the directory path you want to change to.
The **chdir** function returns an integer value. If the operation is successful, it
returns **0**. If there is an error, it returns **-1** , and you can check the value of
the global variable **errno** to determine the specific error condition.

### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```
int main() { const char *path = "/path/to/directory"; (^)
// Change the current working directory
if (chdir(path) == 0) {
printf("Directory changed to: %s\n", path);
} else {
perror("chdir() error");
return 1;
}
return 0;
}
In this example, we define a **path** variable that contains the directory path we
want to change to. We pass this path to the **chdir** function. If the **chdir**
operation is successful, it prints a message indicating that the directory has
been changed. Otherwise, it prints an error message using **perror**.


The **chdir** function is commonly used when you need to change the working
directory within your program. It allows you to navigate to different directories,
perform file operations, and access files or directories in the new working
directory.

## Stat

### Library

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

### Prototype

```
int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf);
```
### Description

The **stat** function in C is used to retrieve information about a file or directory.
It allows you to obtain various attributes and metadata associated with the
specified file or directory, such as file size, permissions, timestamps, and
more.
The **stat** function takes two arguments: **path** and **buf**. Here's an
explanation of each:

**path** : A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the file or
directory path for which you want to retrieve information.
**buf** : A pointer to a **struct stat** object where the retrieved file information
will be stored. The **struct stat** contains fields to hold various attributes
like file size, permissions, timestamps, and more.
The **stat** function returns an integer value. If the operation is successful, it
returns **0**. If there is an error, it returns **-1** , and you can check the value of
the global variable **errno** to determine the specific error condition.

### Example in C


```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
const char *path = "/path/to/file";
struct stat fileStat;
// Retrieve information about the fileif (stat(path, &fileStat) == 0) {
printf("File Size: %lld bytes\\n", (long long)fileStat.st_size);
printf("Permissions: %o\\n", fileStat.st_mode & 0777);
// ... Retrieve and print other attributes as needed
} else {
perror("stat() error");
return 1;
}
return 0;
}
```
```
In this example, we define a path variable representing the file path for which
we want to retrieve information. We declare a struct stat variable fileStat
to hold the file information. We then call the stat function, passing the path
and the address of fileStat. If the stat operation is successful, we print
various attributes of the file, such as its size and permissions. Otherwise, it
prints an error message using perror.
The stat function is commonly used when you need to access and analyze
file attributes and metadata within your program. It allows you to retrieve
information about files or directories, enabling you to perform operations
based on their characteristics.
```
## lstat

### Libraries

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

### Prototype


```
int lstat(const char *path, struct stat *buf);
```
### Description

The **lstat** function in C is similar to the **stat** function. It is used to retrieve
information about a file or symbolic link, just like **stat**. However, **lstat** differs in
its behavior when the specified path refers to a symbolic link.
The **lstat** function takes two arguments: **path** and **buf** , similar to the **stat**
function. Here's an explanation of each:
**path** : A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the file or symbolic
link path for which you want to retrieve information.
**buf** : A pointer to a **struct stat** object where the retrieved file information will
be stored, just like with **stat**.
The **lstat** function returns an integer value. If the operation is successful, it
returns **0**. If there is an error, it returns **-1** , and you can check the value of the
global variable **errno** to determine the specific error condition.
The difference between **stat** and **lstat** lies in how they handle symbolic links.
When **stat** is used on a symbolic link, it retrieves information about the target file
of the link. In contrast, **lstat** retrieves information about the symbolic link itself,
rather than the target file.

### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
const char *path = "/path/to/symlink";
struct stat fileStat;
// Retrieve information about the symbolic link
if (lstat(path, &fileStat) == 0) {
```
if (S_ISLNK(fileStat.st_mode)) { printf("%s is a symbolic link.\n", path); (^)
} else {
printf("%s is not a symbolic link.\n", path);
}
// ... Retrieve and print other attributes as needed
} else {
perror("lstat() error");


```
return 1; }
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we specify a **path** variable representing the path of a symbolic
link. We declare a **struct stat** variable **fileStat** to store the retrieved information.
We then call the **lstat** function, passing the path and the address of **fileStat**. If
the **lstat** operation is successful, we check if the path is a symbolic link using
**S_ISLNK** macro. If it is a symbolic link, we print a corresponding message.
Otherwise, we indicate that it is not a symbolic link. Other attributes can be
retrieved and printed based on your requirements.
The **lstat** function is particularly useful when you need to determine if a given
path refers to a symbolic link and retrieve information about the link itself rather
than its target file.

## fstat

### Libraries

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

### Prototype

```
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf);
```
### Description

The **fstat** function in C is used to retrieve information about an open file
descriptor. It allows you to obtain various attributes and metadata associated with
the file or device referenced by the file descriptor.
The **fstat** function takes two arguments: **fd** and **buf**. Here's an explanation of
each:


**fd** : An integer representing the file descriptor of the open file for which you
want to retrieve information.
**buf** : A pointer to a **struct stat** object where the retrieved file information will
be stored. The **struct stat** contains fields to hold various attributes like file
size, permissions, timestamps, and more.
The **fstat** function returns an integer value. If the operation is successful, it
returns **0**. If there is an error, it returns **-1** , and you can check the value of the
global variable **errno** to determine the specific error condition.

### Example in C

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
const char *filename = "/path/to/file";
int fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
if (fd == -1) {
perror("open() error");
return 1;
}
struct stat fileStat;
// Retrieve information about the open file descriptor
if (fstat(fd, &fileStat) == 0) {
printf("File Size: %lld bytes\n", (long long)fileStat.st_size);
printf("Permissions: %o\n", fileStat.st_mode & 0777);
// ... Retrieve and print other attributes as needed
} else {
perror("fstat() error");
close(fd);
return 1;
}
close(fd);
return 0;}
```
n this example, we open a file specified by **filename** using the **open** function and
obtain the file descriptor **fd**. We then declare a **struct stat** variable **fileStat** to
store the retrieved information. We call the **fstat** function, passing the file
descriptor and the address of **fileStat**. If the **fstat** operation is successful, we


print various attributes of the file, such as its size and permissions. Otherwise, it
prints an error message using **perror**.
The **fstat** function is commonly used when you already have an open file
descriptor and need to access and analyze its attributes and metadata. It allows
you to retrieve information about the file or device associated with the descriptor,
providing insights into its properties and characteristics.

## unlink

The unlink function in C is used to remove a file from the file system. It is
commonly used to delete a file by specifying its file path.
Here's the function signature of unlink:

```
int unlink(const char *path);
```
The unlink function takes a single argument path, which is a pointer to a null-
terminated string representing the path of the file you want to delete.
The unlink function returns an integer value. If the operation is successful, it
returns 0. If there is an error, it returns -1, and you can check the value of the
global variable errno to determine the specific error condition.
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of unlink:

#include <stdio.h>#include <unistd.h> (^)
int main() {
const char *path = "/path/to/file";
// Remove the file from the file system
if (unlink(path) == 0) {
printf("File '%s' successfully deleted.\\n", path);
} else {
perror("unlink() error");
return 1;
}
return 0;}
In this example, we specify the path variable representing the path of the file we
want to delete. We call the unlink function, passing the file path. If the unlink


operation is successful, it prints a message indicating that the file has been
successfully deleted. Otherwise, it prints an error message using perror.
It's important to note that the unlink function deletes the file permanently from the
file system. Once a file is deleted, it cannot be easily recovered unless you have
a backup or a file recovery mechanism in place. Therefore, exercise caution when
using the unlink function to avoid accidental deletion of important files.
Additionally, the behavior of the unlink function may vary depending on the file
system and operating system you are using. For example, on some systems,
symbolic links are only removed by the unlink function, while the target file
remains unaffected.
Overall, the unlink function provides a way to remove files programmatically,
allowing you to manage the file system and delete unwanted files as needed.

## execve

The execve function in C is used to execute a program or command in place of
the current process. It is one of the exec family of functions available in C that
allows you to replace the current process image with a new one.
Here's the function signature of execve:

```
int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
```
The execve function takes three arguments: pathname, argv, and envp. Here's an
explanation of each:
pathname: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing the path of the
executable file you want to execute.
argv: An array of null-terminated strings representing the command-line
arguments to be passed to the new program. The first element of the array
should be the program name itself.
envp: An array of null-terminated strings representing the environment
variables to be passed to the new program. The array should be terminated
with a NULL pointer.
The execve function does not return if it is successful. Instead, it replaces the
current process image with the new program image. If there is an error, it returns


-1, and you can check the value of the global variable errno to determine the
specific error condition.
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of execve:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
const char *path = "/bin/ls";
char *const args[] = { "ls", "-l", NULL };
char *const envp[] = { NULL };
// Execute the "ls -l" command
if (execve(path, args, envp) == -1) {
perror("execve() error");
return 1;
}
```
(^) return 0;
}
In this example, we specify the path variable representing the path of the
executable file we want to execute, which is the ls command in this case. We
define args as an array of strings, where the first element is the program name
("ls") and the second element is the command-line argument ("-l"). We set
envp as an array with a NULL pointer since we are not passing any specific
environment variables.
The execve function is then called with the specified path, args, and envp. If the
execve operation is successful, the current process is replaced by the ls
command, and its output will be displayed. If there is an error, it prints an error
message using perror.
It's important to note that the execve function replaces the current process image,
so any code after the execve call will not be executed unless the execve function
fails. The new program image takes over the process, inheriting the open file
descriptors, signal handlers, and other process attributes.
The execve function is commonly used in situations where you want to execute a
different program or command from within your C program, allowing for dynamic
program execution and process control.

## Dup


The **dup** function in C is used to duplicate a file descriptor. It creates a new file
descriptor that refers to the same open file description as the original file
descriptor. In other words, it allows you to create a copy of an existing file
descriptor.
Here's the function signature of **dup** :

```
int dup(int oldfd);
```
The **dup** function takes a single argument **oldfd** , which is the file descriptor you
want to duplicate.
The **dup** function returns a new file descriptor if the operation is successful. If
there is an error, it returns **-1** , and you can check the value of the global variable
**errno** to determine the specific error condition.
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of **dup** :

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
```
int main() { int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY); (^)
if (fd == -1) {
perror("open() error");
return 1;
}
// Duplicate the file descriptor
int newfd = dup(fd);
if (newfd == -1) {
perror("dup() error");
close(fd);
return 1;
}
// Both 'fd' and 'newfd' now refer to the same open file description
// ... Use 'fd' and 'newfd' for reading or other operations
close(fd);
close(newfd);
return 0;
}
In this example, we first open a file named **"file.txt"** using the **open** function and
obtain the file descriptor **fd**. We then call the **dup** function, passing **fd** as the


argument. If the **dup** operation is successful, it creates a new file descriptor **newfd**
that refers to the same open file description as **fd**.
After duplicating the file descriptor, both **fd** and **newfd** can be used
interchangeably to perform read operations, seek operations, or any other
operations that can be performed on file descriptors. Any changes made to the
file position indicator or file status flags using one file descriptor will affect the
other.
It's important to note that the duplicated file descriptor is inherited from the
original file descriptor and retains the same properties, such as the file position
and file access mode. However, the two file descriptors are independent of each
other and can be closed separately.
The **dup** function is commonly used in scenarios where you need multiple
references to the same open file, such as redirecting standard input/output/error
streams, implementing pipelines, or performing concurrent I/O operations on the
same file.
Remember to close both the original file descriptor and the duplicated file
descriptor when you no longer need them to release system resources properly.

## Dup2

The **dup2** function in C is similar to the **dup** function in that it duplicates a file
descriptor, but it allows you to explicitly specify the target file descriptor for the
duplication. This provides more control over the duplication process compared to
**dup**.
Here's the function signature of **dup2** :

```
cCopy code
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
```
The **dup2** function takes two arguments: **oldfd** and **newfd**. Here's an explanation
of each:
**oldfd** : The file descriptor you want to duplicate.
**newfd** : The desired file descriptor number for the duplicate. If **newfd** is already
a valid open file descriptor, it is closed before the duplication takes place. If
**newfd** is not a valid file descriptor, it is created as a result of the duplication.


The **dup2** function returns a new file descriptor if the operation is successful. If
there is an error, it returns **-1** , and you can check the value of the global variable
**errno** to determine the specific error condition.
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of **dup2** :

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
```
(^) int main() {
int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
if (fd == -1) {
perror("open() error");
return 1;
}
// Duplicate the file descriptor to a specific target descriptor
int newfd = dup2(fd, 5);
if (newfd == -1) {
perror("dup2() error");
close(fd);
return 1;
}
// 'newfd' now refers to the same open file description as 'fd',
// but with the specific target descriptor '5'
// ... Use 'newfd' (or 'fd') for reading or other operations
close(fd);
close(newfd);
return 0;
}
In this example, we open a file named **"file.txt"** using the **open** function and
obtain the file descriptor **fd**. We then call the **dup2** function, passing **fd** as the
source file descriptor and **5** as the desired target file descriptor. If the **dup2**
operation is successful, it duplicates the file descriptor **fd** to the target file
descriptor **5**.
After duplicating the file descriptor, **newfd** refers to the same open file description
as **fd** , but with the specific target file descriptor **5**. Any operations performed on
**newfd** (or **fd** ) will affect the same open file.
One significant difference between **dup** and **dup2** is that **dup2** allows you to
explicitly specify the target file descriptor, whereas **dup** automatically chooses the
lowest available file descriptor number.


The **dup2** function is commonly used when you want to explicitly control the file
descriptor number, such as redirecting standard input/output/error streams to
specific file descriptors or ensuring that a particular file descriptor is used for a
specific purpose.
Remember to close both the original file descriptor ( **fd** ) and the duplicated file
descriptor ( **newfd** ) when you no longer need them to release system resources
properly.

## Pipe

The **pipe** function in C is used to create an interprocess communication channel
known as a pipe. It provides a way for two related processes to communicate by
connecting the standard output of one process to the standard input of another
process.
Here's the function signature of **pipe** :

```
cCopy code
int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
```
The **pipe** function takes a single argument **pipefd** , which is an array of two
integers representing the file descriptors of the pipe. The first element ( **pipefd[0]** )
is used for reading from the pipe, and the second element ( **pipefd[1]** ) is used for
writing to the pipe.
The **pipe** function returns **0** if the operation is successful. If there is an error, it
returns **-1** , and you can check the value of the global variable **errno** to
determine the specific error condition.
Here's how the **pipe** function works:
1. You declare an integer array with two elements to hold the file descriptors of
the pipe: **int pipefd[2];**
2. You call the **pipe** function, passing the **pipefd** array as the argument:
**pipe(pipefd);**
3. If the **pipe** operation is successful, the **pipefd** array is updated with two file
descriptors. **pipefd[0]** refers to the read end of the pipe, and **pipefd[1]** refers
to the write end of the pipe.


4. The read end ( **pipefd[0]** ) is used by the process to read data from the pipe. It
should be closed in any process that intends to write to the pipe.
5. The write end ( **pipefd[1]** ) is used by the process to write data into the pipe. It
should be closed in any process that intends to read from the pipe.
6. The two related processes can communicate by writing data from one end
( **pipefd[1]** ) and reading it from the other end ( **pipefd[0]** ).
Here's an example to illustrate the usage of **pipe** in a parent-child process
scenario:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```
int main() { int pipefd[2]; (^)
if (pipe(pipefd) == -1) {
perror("pipe() error");
return 1;
}
// Fork a child process
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == -1) {
perror("fork() error");
return 1;
} else if (pid == 0) {
// Child process
// Close the write end of the pipe
close(pipefd[1]);
// Read from the read end of the pipe
char buffer[100];
ssize_t bytesRead = read(pipefd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
// Process the received data
printf("Child process received: %.*s\n", (int)bytesRead, buffer);
// Close the read end of the pipe
close(pipefd[0]);
return 0; } else {
// Parent process
// Close the read end of the pipe
close(pipefd[0]);
// Write to the write end of the pipe
const char *message = "Hello from the parent process!";
ssize_t bytesWritten = write(pipefd[1], message, strlen(message));


```
// Close the write end of the pipe close(pipefd[1]);
// Wait for the child process to terminate
wait(NULL);
return 0;
}
}
```
In this example, the parent process creates a pipe using the **pipe** function. It then
forks a child process. The child process inherits the file descriptors of the pipe
from the parent.
In the child process, the write end of the pipe ( **pipefd[1]** ) is closed since it will
only read from the pipe. It reads data from the read end of the pipe ( **pipefd[0]** )
using the **read** function and processes the received data.
In the parent process, the read end of the pipe ( **pipefd[0]** ) is closed since it will
only write to the pipe. It writes a message to the write end of the pipe

## opendir & closedir

The **opendir** function in C is used to open a directory stream, allowing you to
access the contents of a directory. It returns a pointer to a **DIR** structure that
represents the opened directory.
The **closedir** function in C is used to close a directory stream that was previously
opened with the **opendir** function. It releases the resources associated with the
directory stream.
Here's the function signature of **opendir** :

```
DIR *opendir(const char *dirname);
```
(^) int closedir(DIR *dir);
The **opendir** function takes a single argument **dirname** , which is the name of the
directory you want to open.
The **opendir** function returns a pointer to a **DIR** structure if the operation is
successful. If there is an error, it returns **NULL** , indicating the failure to open the
directory. You can check the value of the global variable **errno** to determine the
specific error condition.


he **closedir** function returns **0** if the operation is successful. If there is an error, it
returns **-1**
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of **opendir** and **closedir** :

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dirent.h>
int main() {
const char *dirname = "/path/to/directory";
// Open the directory
DIR *dir = opendir(dirname);
if (dir == NULL) {
perror("opendir() error");
return 1;
}
```
(^) // Read the directory entries
struct dirent *entry;
while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
printf("%s\n", entry->d_name);
}
// Close the directory
closedir(dir);
return 0;
}
In this example, we provide the directory name as a string to the **opendir** function.
If the **opendir** operation is successful, it returns a pointer to a **DIR** structure that
represents the opened directory.
Once the directory is open, you can use the **readdir** function in a loop to read the
entries within the directory. The **readdir** function returns a pointer to a **struct
dirent** structure, which contains information about the directory entry. In this
example, we simply print the name of each directory entry.
After you finish working with the directory, it's important to close it using the
**closedir** function. This releases the resources associated with the directory
stream.
The **opendir** function is commonly used when you need to access the contents of
a directory, such as listing files, searching for specific files, or traversing directory
hierarchies.
Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the opening or reading of
the directory and close the directory when you are done to avoid resource leaks.


## readdir

The **readdir** function in C is used to read the next directory entry from a directory
stream opened with the **opendir** function. It retrieves information about each entry
within the directory.
Here's the function signature of **readdir** :

```
struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dir);
```
The **readdir** function takes a single argument **dir** , which is a pointer to the **DIR**
structure representing the directory stream.
The **readdir** function returns a pointer to a **struct dirent** structure if the operation
is successful. This structure contains information about the directory entry, such
as its name and file type. If the end of the directory stream is reached or an error
occurs, it returns **NULL**.
Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of **readdir** :

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dirent.h>
```
int main() { const char *dirname = "/path/to/directory"; (^)
// Open the directory
DIR *dir = opendir(dirname);
if (dir == NULL) {
perror("opendir() error");
return 1;
}
// Read the directory entries
struct dirent *entry;
while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
printf("%s\n", entry->d_name);
}
(^) // Close the directory
closedir(dir);
return 0;
}
In this example, after successfully opening the directory using **opendir** , we use a
loop to iterate through the directory entries using the **readdir** function. The loop


continues until **readdir** returns **NULL** , indicating that all directory entries have
been read or an error has occurred.
For each directory entry, we can access its name through the **d_name** member of
the **struct dirent** structure and perform any necessary operations or display the
information.
It's important to note that the order in which directory entries are read is not
guaranteed. If you require a specific order, you may need to sort the entries
yourself.
After you have finished reading the directory entries, it's essential to close the
directory stream using the **closedir** function to release the associated resources.
The **readdir** function is commonly used in conjunction with the **opendir** and
**closedir** functions to traverse and retrieve information about the contents of a
directory.
Remember to handle any errors that may occur during the reading of directory
entries and close the directory stream when you are done to avoid resource
leaks.

### About the dirent structure

Certainly! The **struct dirent** structure in C is defined in the **<dirent.h>** header file
and is used to represent a directory entry. It contains information about a single
file or subdirectory within a directory.
Here's the structure definition of **struct dirent** :

```
cCopy code
struct dirent {
ino_t d_ino; // inode number
off_t d_off; // offset to the next dirent
unsigned short d_reclen; // length of this record
unsigned char d_type; // type of file
char d_name[256]; // filename
};
```
Let's go through the members of the **struct dirent** structure:
**d_ino** : This member represents the inode number of the directory entry,
which is a unique identifier assigned to each file or directory by the filesystem.
**d_off** : This member specifies the offset to the next directory entry. It is
typically used for directory traversal purposes.


```
d_reclen : This member denotes the length of the directory entry record in
bytes. It can be useful in certain scenarios when working directly with
directory entries.
d_type : This member indicates the type of the file or directory entry. The
specific values of d_type can vary across different platforms, but common
values include DT_REG for regular files, DT_DIR for directories, DT_LNK for
symbolic links, and so on. You can refer to the <dirent.h> header file for the
complete list of possible values.
d_name : This member is an array of characters representing the name of the
file or directory entry. It is typically null-terminated and has a maximum size of
256 characters. The actual name of the entry is stored in this array.
```
## strerror & perror

Both **strerror** and **perror** are functions in C that provide error handling and error
message retrieval capabilities.
1. **strerror** function:
**strerror** function is declared in the **<string.h>** header file.
It takes an error number as an argument and returns a pointer to a string
that describes the corresponding error message.
The error number is typically obtained from the global variable **errno** ,
which holds the error code of the most recent error that occurred in the
program.
The returned string from **strerror** provides a human-readable description
of the error, making it useful for error reporting and debugging.
Here's an example usage of **strerror** :

```
#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <errno.h>int main() {
FILE *file = fopen("nonexistent.txt", "r");
if (file == NULL) {
printf("Error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
}
return 0;
}
```

```
In this example, strerror(errno) retrieves the error message
corresponding to the value stored in errno and prints it as part of the
error message.
2. perror function:
perror function is declared in the <stdio.h> header file.
It is used to print an error message to the standard error stream ( stderr )
along with a custom prefix string.
The error message printed by perror is based on the value stored in the
global variable errno.
perror automatically appends a colon and a space after the custom
prefix string, followed by the error message.
Here's an example usage of perror :
```
```
#include <stdio.h>#include <errno.h>int main() {
FILE *file = fopen("nonexistent.txt", "r");
if (file == NULL) {
perror("File open error");
}
return 0;
}
```
In this example, **perror("File open error")** prints the custom prefix string
"File open error" followed by a colon, a space, and the error message
corresponding to the value stored in **errno**.
Both **strerror** and **perror** are useful for handling errors and providing meaningful
error messages in C programs. **strerror** allows you to retrieve error messages as
strings, while **perror** provides a convenient way to print error messages along
with custom prefixes.

## isatty

The isatty function in C is used to determine whether a file descriptor is
associated with a terminal or not. It helps to identify if a particular input or output
stream is connected to an interactive terminal device.
Here's the function signature of isatty:


```
int isatty(int fd);
```
The isatty function takes a single argument fd, which is the file descriptor for
the stream or file you want to check.
The function returns a value of 1 (true) if the file descriptor refers to a terminal,
and 0 (false) otherwise. If an error occurs, it returns -1, and you can check the
value of the global variable errno to determine the specific error condition.
Here's an example usage of isatty:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
if (isatty(STDIN_FILENO)) {
printf("Standard input is connected to a terminal.\\n"); } else {
printf("Standard input is not connected to a terminal.\\n");
}
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use isatty to check if the standard input file descriptor
(STDIN_FILENO) is associated with a terminal. Depending on the result, we print an
appropriate message indicating whether it is connected to a terminal or not.
The isatty function is often used in interactive programs or when you need to
differentiate between input/output streams connected to a terminal and those
connected to other devices or files. It allows you to adapt the behavior of your
program based on the type of input or output stream being used.
Keep in mind that the behavior of isatty may vary across different platforms or
operating systems, so it's important to consult the documentation or specific
system headers for accurate information regarding its usage and supported file
descriptors.

## ttyname

The ttyname function in C is used to retrieve the name of the terminal associated
with a given file descriptor. It returns a string representing the path of the terminal
device file.


Here's the function signature of ttyname:

```
char *ttyname(int fd);
```
The ttyname function takes a single argument fd, which is the file descriptor for
which you want to determine the associated terminal device.
The function returns a pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path name
of the terminal device associated with the specified file descriptor. If the file
descriptor is not associated with a terminal or an error occurs, the function returns
NULL.
Here's an example usage of ttyname:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
char *terminal = ttyname(STDOUT_FILENO);
if (terminal != NULL) {
printf("Terminal: %s\\n", terminal);
} else {
printf("STDOUT is not associated with a terminal.\\n");
}
```
(^) return 0;
}
In this example, we use ttyname to retrieve the name of the terminal associated
with the standard output file descriptor (STDOUT_FILENO). If a terminal is associated,
we print the terminal name; otherwise, we print a message indicating that STDOUT
is not associated with a terminal.
The ttyname function is commonly used when you need to determine the path of
the terminal device file associated with a specific file descriptor. It can be useful in
various scenarios, such as when you want to perform operations or gather
information specific to the terminal device.
It's important to note that ttyname may return NULL in situations where the file
descriptor is not associated with a terminal or if an error occurs. Therefore, it's a
good practice to check the return value before using the string pointer to avoid
potential issues.
Also, keep in mind that the behavior and availability of ttyname may vary across
different platforms or operating systems, so it's always recommended to consult


the documentation or specific system headers for accurate information regarding
its usage and support.

## ioctl

The ioctl function in C is a versatile system call that provides a way to perform
various control operations on devices or file descriptors that are not covered by
other standard functions.
Here's the function signature of ioctl:

```
int ioctl(int fd, unsigned long request, ...);
```
The ioctl function takes three arguments:

fd: The file descriptor or device identifier on which the control operation will
be performed.
request: An unsigned long value that represents the specific control operation
to be carried out.
...: Optional additional arguments required by certain control operations.
The actual arguments depend on the specific request being made.
The ioctl function returns an integer value indicating the success or failure of the
operation. The meaning of the return value varies depending on the specific
control operation being performed.
The ioctl function allows you to interact with devices or file descriptors in a
flexible manner, enabling operations such as:
Querying or modifying device parameters.
Controlling I/O operations.
Retrieving device-specific information.
Configuring terminal settings.
Performing various driver-specific actions.
The specific control operations that ioctl supports depend on the device, file
descriptor, and operating system. These control operations are typically defined
by constants or macros specific to the device or driver being used.
Here's a general example usage of ioctl for controlling terminal settings:


```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <termios.h>
int main() {
int fd = STDIN_FILENO; // Example file descriptor, such as stdin
struct termios term;
if (ioctl(fd, TCGETS, &term) == -1) {
perror("ioctl"); return 1;
}
// Modify terminal settings as needed
term.c_lflag &= ~ECHO;
if (ioctl(fd, TCSETS, &term) == -1) {
perror("ioctl");
return 1;
}
printf("Terminal settings modified successfully.\\n");
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use ioctl to get the current terminal settings (TCGETS) using
the ioctl request code TCGETS. Then, we modify the terminal settings by
disabling echoing of input characters. Finally, we use ioctl again with the TCSETS
request code to set the modified terminal settings.
It's important to note that the specific usage and available control operations of
ioctl depend on the device or file descriptor being used. The documentation or
specific system headers for the device or driver should be consulted to determine
the appropriate control operations and their corresponding request codes.
Also, keep in mind that ioctl is a low-level and platform-specific interface, and its
usage may vary across different operating systems or devices. It's generally
recommended to use higher-level, more portable abstractions when available, as
they provide better compatibility and maintainability.

## getenv

The getenv function in C is used to retrieve the value of an environment variable.
Environment variables are used to store configuration or runtime information that
can be accessed by programs running on the system.
Here's the function signature of getenv:


```
char *getenv(const char *name);
```
The getenv function takes a single argument name, which is a string representing
the name of the environment variable you want to retrieve.
The function returns a pointer to a null-terminated string containing the value of
the environment variable. If the environment variable is found, the function returns
a valid pointer to the value. If the environment variable does not exist or an error
occurs, the function returns NULL.
Here's an example usage of getenv:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
char *home = getenv("HOME");
if (home != NULL) {
printf("Home directory: %s\\n", home);
} else {
printf("Home directory not found.\\n");
}
return 0;}
```
In this example, we use getenv to retrieve the value of the HOME environment
variable, which typically stores the path to the user's home directory. If the
environment variable is found, we print the value; otherwise, we print a message
indicating that the home directory was not found.
The getenv function is commonly used when you need to access configuration or
runtime information stored in environment variables. These variables can vary
depending on the system and user configuration, providing flexibility and
customization for programs.
It's important to note that the returned string pointer from getenv points to internal
memory managed by the C runtime environment. Therefore, you should not
modify or free the returned string, as it may lead to undefined behavior.
Additionally, environment variables are typically set externally or by the system,
so they may not always be available or provide the expected values. It's a good
practice to check the return value of getenv for NULL before using the string
pointer to handle cases where the environment variable is not found.


## tcsetattr

The tcsetattr function in C is used to set the terminal attributes associated with a
given file descriptor. It allows you to configure various aspects of terminal
behavior, such as input modes, output modes, control characters, and line
discipline.
Here's the function signature of tcsetattr:

```
int tcsetattr(int fd, int optional_actions, const struct termios *termios_p);
```
The tcsetattr function takes three arguments:
fd: The file descriptor representing the terminal on which the attributes will
be set.
optional_actions: An integer value specifying the action to be taken. It can be
one of the following constants: TCSANOW, TCSADRAIN, or TCSAFLUSH.
TCSANOW: Changes are made immediately.
TCSADRAIN: Changes are made after transmitting all output.
TCSAFLUSH: Changes are made after transmitting all output and discarding
all input.
termios_p: A pointer to a struct termios object that contains the new terminal
attributes to be set.
The tcsetattr function returns 0 on success or -1 if an error occurs.
Here's an example usage of tcsetattr to disable echoing of input characters:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
struct termios term;
if (tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term) == -1) {
perror("tcgetattr");
return 1; }
term.c_lflag &= ~ECHO;
if (tcsetattr(STDIN_FILENO, TCSANOW, &term) == -1) {
perror("tcsetattr");
return 1;
```

```
}
printf("Terminal settings modified successfully.\\n");
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use tcgetattr to retrieve the current terminal attributes
(struct termios) associated with the standard input file descriptor (STDIN_FILENO).
We then modify the c_lflag member of the term structure to disable echoing of
input characters by clearing the ECHO flag. Finally, we use tcsetattr with the
TCSANOW action to set the modified terminal attributes.
It's important to note that the termios structure contains multiple members
representing different aspects of terminal behavior, such as input modes, output
modes, control characters, and more. You can modify the desired members of the
structure to achieve the desired terminal configuration.
The tcsetattr function provides a powerful way to control and customize terminal
behavior. However, it's important to handle errors appropriately and restore the
original terminal attributes when necessary to ensure proper functioning of the
terminal.
Additionally, keep in mind that the behavior and availability of terminal-related
functions may vary across different platforms or operating systems. It's
recommended to consult the documentation or specific system headers for
accurate information regarding their usage and support.

## tcgetattr

The tcgetattr function in C is used to retrieve the current terminal attributes
associated with a given file descriptor. It allows you to obtain the current
configuration of various aspects of terminal behavior, such as input modes, output
modes, control characters, and line discipline.
Here's the function signature of tcgetattr:

```
int tcgetattr(int fd, struct termios *termios_p);
```
The tcgetattr function takes two arguments:
fd: The file descriptor representing the terminal for which you want to
retrieve the attributes.


termios_p: A pointer to a struct termios object where the retrieved terminal
attributes will be stored.
The tcgetattr function returns 0 on success or -1 if an error occurs.
Here's an example usage of tcgetattr:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termios.h>#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
struct termios term;
if (tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term) == -1) {
perror("tcgetattr");
return 1;
}
// Access and utilize terminal attributes in the 'term' structure
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use tcgetattr to retrieve the current terminal attributes
associated with the standard input file descriptor (STDIN_FILENO). We provide the
address of a struct termios object named term where the attributes will be
stored.
Once the tcgetattr call is successful, you can access and utilize the retrieved
terminal attributes in the term structure. The structure contains various members
representing different aspects of terminal behavior, such as c_iflag for input
modes, c_oflag for output modes, c_cflag for control modes, c_lflag for local
modes, and c_cc for control characters.
Here's an example of accessing and printing some terminal attributes:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main() {
struct termios term;
if (tcgetattr(STDIN_FILENO, &term) == -1) { perror("tcgetattr");
return 1;
}
printf("Input flags: 0x%lx\\n", term.c_iflag);
printf("Output flags: 0x%lx\\n", term.c_oflag);
printf("Control flags: 0x%lx\\n", term.c_cflag);
```

```
printf("Local flags: 0x%lx\\n", term.c_lflag);
// Access and utilize other attributes as needed
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we print the values of c_iflag, c_oflag, c_cflag, and c_lflag to
display the input flags, output flags, control flags, and local flags, respectively.
The struct termios provides a comprehensive set of attributes that you can
modify or analyze to configure or understand the terminal behavior. Each attribute
member has its own set of flags or values that control specific aspects of the
terminal.
It's important to note that the behavior and availability of terminal-related functions
may vary across different platforms or operating systems. It's recommended to
consult the documentation or specific system headers for accurate information
regarding their usage and support.

## tgetent

The tgetent function in C is part of the termcap library and is used to retrieve the
capabilities and characteristics of a specific terminal type from the termcap
database. The termcap database contains information about various terminal
types and their capabilities, allowing programs to adapt their behavior
accordingly.
Here's the function signature of tgetent:

```
int tgetent(char *bp, const char *name);
```
The tgetent function takes two arguments:
bp: A buffer where the termcap entry for the specified terminal type will be
stored.
name: The name of the terminal type for which you want to retrieve the
termcap entry.
The tgetent function returns one of the following values:
1 : The termcap entry was successfully found and loaded into the buffer.


0 : The termcap entry was not found or the termcap database is not
accessible.
1 : An error occurred while reading the termcap database.
Here's an example usage of tgetent:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termcap.h>
int main() {
char term_buffer[1024];
const char *term_type = "xterm"; // Example terminal type
if (tgetent(term_buffer, term_type) == 1) {
printf("Termcap entry for '%s' retrieved successfully.\\n", term_type);
} else {
printf("Failed to retrieve termcap entry for '%s'.\\n", term_type);
}
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use tgetent to retrieve the termcap entry for the terminal type
"xterm". The termcap entry is loaded into the term_buffer character array. If the
return value of tgetent is 1, it indicates that the termcap entry was successfully
retrieved and we print a success message. Otherwise, we print a failure
message.
The termcap entry retrieved by tgetent contains information about the terminal
type, such as the control sequences for various capabilities, such as cursor
movement, color support, and more. You can then use other termcap functions,
such as tgetstr, to extract specific capabilities from the termcap entry and utilize
them in your program.
It's important to note that the termcap library is older and has been largely
superseded by the more modern and portable terminfo database and associated
functions (such as tgetent in ncurses). However, on some systems, the termcap
library may still be available and used for compatibility reasons.
When working with terminal capabilities, it's generally recommended to use the
terminfo database and related functions, such as those provided by ncurses or
termios libraries, as they offer more flexibility, portability, and support for modern
terminal features.

## tgetflag????!


## tgetnum

The tgetnum function is part of the termcap library and is used to retrieve numeric
values (such as terminal screen dimensions or terminal-specific parameters) from
the termcap database. The termcap database contains information about various
terminal types and their capabilities, allowing programs to adapt their behavior
accordingly.
Here's the function signature of tgetnum:

```
int tgetnum(const char *name);
```
The tgetnum function takes one argument:
name: The name of the numeric capability for which you want to retrieve the
value.
The tgetnum function returns the numeric value of the specified capability, or -1 if
the capability is not found or has no numeric value.
Here's an example usage of tgetnum to retrieve the number of columns in the
terminal:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termcap.h>
int main() {
const char *columns_capability = "co";
int num_columns = tgetnum(columns_capability);
if (num_columns != -1) {
printf("Number of columns in the terminal: %d\\n", num_columns);
} else {
printf("Failed to retrieve the number of columns.\\n");
}
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use tgetnum to retrieve the value of the "co" capability, which
represents the number of columns in the terminal. If the return value of tgetnum is
not -1, we print the number of columns. Otherwise, we print a failure message.
The tgetnum function allows you to access other numeric capabilities from the
termcap database, such as terminal screen height ("li"), tab stop width ("it"), and


more. The specific capabilities available and their meanings may vary depending
on the terminal type and the entries in the termcap database.
It's important to note that the termcap library is older and has been largely
superseded by the more modern and portable terminfo database and associated
functions (such as those provided by ncurses). However, on some systems, the
termcap library may still be available and used for compatibility reasons.
When working with terminal capabilities, it's generally recommended to use the
terminfo database and related functions, such as those provided by ncurses or
termios libraries, as they offer more flexibility, portability, and support for modern
terminal features.

## tgetstr

Yes, tgetstr is similar to tgetnum in that it is also part of the termcap library and is
used to retrieve string values (such as control sequences or terminal-specific
parameters) from the termcap database. The termcap database contains
information about various terminal types and their capabilities, allowing programs
to adapt their behavior accordingly.
Here's the function signature of tgetstr:

```
char *tgetstr(const char *name, char **area);
```
The tgetstr function takes two arguments:

name: The name of the string capability for which you want to retrieve the
value.
area: A pointer to a character pointer that serves as a temporary storage
area for the retrieved string.
The tgetstr function returns a pointer to the retrieved string value of the specified
capability, or NULL if the capability is not found or has no string value.
Here's an example usage of tgetstr to retrieve the control sequence for clearing
the screen:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termcap.h>
int main() {
const char *clear_sequence_capability = "cl";
```

```
char *clear_sequence = tgetstr(clear_sequence_capability, NULL);
if (clear_sequence != NULL) {
printf("Clear screen sequence: %s\\n", clear_sequence);
} else {
printf("Failed to retrieve the clear screen sequence.\\n");
}
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use tgetstr to retrieve the value of the "cl" capability, which
represents the control sequence for clearing the screen. If the return value of
tgetstr is not NULL, we print the clear screen sequence. Otherwise, we print a
failure message.
The tgetstr function allows you to access other string capabilities from the
termcap database, such as cursor movement sequences ("up", "down", "left",
"right"), color control sequences, and more. The specific capabilities available and
their meanings may vary depending on the terminal type and the entries in the
termcap database.
It's important to note that the termcap library is older and has been largely
superseded by the more modern and portable terminfo database and associated
functions (such as those provided by ncurses). However, on some systems, the
termcap library may still be available and used for compatibility reasons.
When working with terminal capabilities, it's generally recommended to use the
terminfo database and related functions, such as those provided by ncurses or
termios libraries, as they offer more flexibility, portability, and support for modern
terminal features.

## tgoto

The tgoto function is part of the termcap library and is used to generate a control
sequence for cursor movement or positioning on the terminal screen. It is often
used in conjunction with other termcap functions, such as tgetstr and tputs, to
perform precise cursor control in terminal-based applications.
Here's the function signature of tgoto:

```
char *tgoto(const char *cm, int destcol, int destline);
```
The tgoto function takes three arguments:


cm: The termcap capability for cursor motion, usually obtained using tgetstr
with the capability name "cm".
destcol: The target column on the terminal screen where you want to position
the cursor.
destline: The target line (row) on the terminal screen where you want to
position the cursor.
The tgoto function returns a pointer to the generated control sequence for the
specified cursor motion. This control sequence can then be used with other
functions, such as tputs, to output the sequence to the terminal.
Here's an example usage of tgoto to generate a control sequence for moving the
cursor to a specific position:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termcap.h>
int main() {
const char *cursor_motion_capability = tgetstr("cm", NULL);
int target_column = 10;
int target_line = 5;
char *control_sequence = tgoto(cursor_motion_capability, target_column, target_
line);
if (control_sequence != NULL) {
printf("Control sequence for cursor motion: %s\\n", control_sequence); } else {
printf("Failed to generate the control sequence for cursor motion.\\n");
}
return 0;
}
```
In this example, we first obtain the cm capability using tgetstr. Then, we specify
the target column and line where we want to move the cursor. We pass these
values along with the cm capability to tgoto, which generates the corresponding
control sequence. If the return value of tgoto is not NULL, we print the generated
control sequence. Otherwise, we print a failure message.
The tgoto function is useful for handling cursor positioning and movement in a
terminal-agnostic way. By using the appropriate termcap capabilities and tgoto,
you can generate control sequences that work across various terminal types and
ensure proper cursor control in your terminal-based applications.


It's important to note that the termcap library is older and has been largely
superseded by the more modern and portable terminfo database and associated
functions (such as those provided by ncurses). However, on some systems, the
termcap library may still be available and used for compatibility reasons.
When working with terminal capabilities, it's generally recommended to use the
terminfo database and related functions, such as those provided by ncurses or
termios libraries, as they offer more flexibility, portability, and support for modern
terminal features.

## tputs

Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of the tputs function along with an
example:
The tputs function is part of the termcap library and is used to output terminal
control sequences to the terminal. It takes a string containing a control sequence
as input and sends it to the terminal for interpretation and execution. The control
sequence can include various commands for tasks such as cursor movement,
text formatting, color manipulation, and more.
Here's the function signature of tputs:

```
int tputs(const char *str, int affcnt, int (*putfunc)(int));
```
The tputs function takes three arguments:

str: The string containing the control sequence to be outputted.
affcnt: The number of lines affected by the control sequence. This is usually
set to 1.
putfunc: A pointer to a function that will handle the actual output of
characters. This can be set to putchar for simple cases.
The tputs function returns an integer value, typically zero on success and a non-
zero value on failure.
Here's an example usage of tputs to output a control sequence for clearing the
screen:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termcap.h>
```

```
int main() { const char *clear_sequence = tgetstr("cl", NULL); // Get the control sequence f
or clearing the screen
if (clear_sequence != NULL) {
tputs(clear_sequence, 1, putchar); // Output the control sequence to the te
rminal
} else {
printf("Failed to retrieve the clear screen sequence.\\n");
}
return 0;
}
```
```
In this example, we use tgetstr to obtain the control sequence for clearing the
screen (capability name "cl"). If the control sequence is successfully retrieved, we
pass it to tputs along with the putchar function as the output handler. This
causes the control sequence to be sent to the terminal, which interprets and
executes it, clearing the screen.
The tputs function is a useful tool for outputting terminal control sequences,
allowing you to perform various operations that manipulate the terminal's
appearance and behavior.
It's important to note that the termcap library is older and has been largely
superseded by the more modern and portable terminfo database and associated
functions (such as those provided by ncurses). However, on some systems, the
termcap library may still be available and used for compatibility reasons.
When working with terminal capabilities, it's generally recommended to use the
terminfo database and related functions, such as those provided by ncurses or
termios libraries, as they offer more flexibility, portability, and support for modern
terminal features.
